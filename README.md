# Food Ordering App - UI
Project #5 from 'React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)' By Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

This was a complete end-to-end project creating a UI to allow users to select items from a restaurant's menu to add them to their cart, as well as view and edit their cart.

## Aims of project
The purpose of this project was to practice using React and consolidate the concepts learnt during the course so far.

The UI is comprised of a number of components including a header, buttons, lists, inputs, cards and a modal.

Some of the concepts and techniques used were:
- Hooks (useContext, useState, useEffect, useReducer, useRef)
- Props
- Portals
- Conditional content

## How to run the app

The app was built using `create-react-app` from the command line.

After cloning the repo, first run `npm install` to install the dependencies in your local environment. 

Then, run `npm start` to start the development server and view at http://localhost:3000.
